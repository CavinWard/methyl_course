# Analysis of DNA methylation from the EPIC Array
This project looks at DNA methylation data from the EPIC arrray and provides an example analysis using publicly available samples from fibroblast samples (GSE99788). 

To begin clone this repository and run the R script 'EPIC EWAS Example Package Install v1.R' which is in the R_code file. This will install the packages needed for the analysis. All packages should install with no errors (though some may have warnings, particuarly about the R version being used). This has been tested with R v3.5.1 with no errors. Though some older versions of these packages may need to be manually deleted before they will install properly. Calling the library('packagename') command can test if the packages installed properly.

You will then need to download the pre-processed methylation data files which are available at this link (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OKLguigp0jfz5ljRLeV_MEbrCHSjFLV6).
